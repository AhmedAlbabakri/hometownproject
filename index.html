                    <h4>Wadi Difarhou Natural Pool</h4>
                    <p>It takes about 1.5 hours to hike to this pool but it’s absolutely worth it.  On the way you’ll pass hundreds of bottle trees and Dragon blood trees.
                    ke – you’ll probably be the only one there!</p>

                    <h4>Zahik Beach and Sand Dunes</h4>
                    <p>Socotra has a lot of sand dunes, especially on the southern side. This is due to off shore winds that carry the sand from the horn of Africa. The dunes at Zahik are some of the most spectacular and the beach isn’t bad either!</p>
